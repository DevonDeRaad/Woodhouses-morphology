# Woodhouses-morphology
Full dataset and scripts for analyses conducted from the manuscript "Phenotypic clines across an unstudied hybrid zone in Woodhouse's Scrub-Jay (Aphelocoma woodhouseii)"

The file scrubspecmorph.csv can be analyzed using the script Fig3_Fig4.R to analyze sex differences and do some informative data visualization. 'Fig.3_4.Rmd' and 'Fig.3_4.docx' show the step by step workflow to analyze morphopological differences between the groups.

The file morph.csv can be analyzed using the scripts "S1B.R" and "pc1 hzar script.R" to create clines for between the Woodhouse's and Sumichrast's lineages for general body size and mantle color. This comprises Fig. 5.
