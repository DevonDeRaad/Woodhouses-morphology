# Woodhouses-morphology
Full dataset and scripts for analyses conducted from the manuscript "Phenotypic clines across an unstudied hybrid zone in Woodhouse's Scrub-Jay (Aphelocoma woodhouseii)"

The file 'scrubspecmorph.csv' can be analyzed using the script 'Fig3_Fig4.R' to analyze sex differences and do some informative data visualization, as well as analyze morphopological differences between the groups.

The files 'femalemorph.csv', 'malemorph.csv', 's1.blue.csv', and 'siteloc.csv' can be analyzed using the script 'fig.5.R' to create clines using hzar, showing the transition between the Woodhouse's and Sumichrast's lineages for general body size for each sex, and mantle color for the sexes combined.
